### Experimentations with earthquake data from Iceland ###

This is something I got keen on when I first discovered what APIs are, at Enspiral Dev Academy. Iceland has heaps of public APIs available, so my plan is to set up a way of gathering the geological data on offer and representing it in a range of ways to map it over time, and make it easy to interpret and maybe even interact with a bit. I'm keen to try working with the following:

* Node
Set up the project with NPM, build a server !
* Babel
I like writing javascript as ES6, and getting familiar with Babel and Browserify to compile it together and use it in the app is a key goal
* D3
For data display in charts, maybe some cool visual mapping stuff

* Mocha Tests
I would like to have some of this, keen to learn more specific testing methods for JS especially when using es6.
