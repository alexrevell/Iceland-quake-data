# Iceland-quake-data
*** Experimentations with earthquake data from Iceland ***

This is something I got keen on when I first discovered what APIs are, at Enspiral Dev Academy. Iceland has heaps of public APIs available, so my plan is to set up a way of gathering the geological data on offer and representing it in a range of ways to map it over time, and make it easy to interpret and maybe even interact with a bit. I'm keen to try working with the following:

* Rails
To set up an API endpoint (or endpoints) of my own to consume and then access particular bits of the Iceland data
* D3 
For data display in charts, maybe some cool visual stuff
* React
For speedy loading and some interactivity for user
* Pusher
Would be cool to set up a live feed type of thing for the quake data, but might not be necessary as they don't happen all that often...

* Jasmine Tests
I have done a bit of this, keen to learn more specific testing methods for JS especially with React as I get to it.

I haven't used D3 or React before, and I may end up not using Rails for this as it might work best just as a front end consumable app... I'm looking forward to finding out as I go.
